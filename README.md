 Aruba Central Administration & Lifecycle Management
This repository (or project summary) captures key tasks and operational procedures I have worked on within Aruba Central, covering full lifecycle management of Aruba network devices such as switches and access points.

## ✅ Key Responsibilities and Tasks
🔌 Onboarding
Onboarded Aruba switches and access points (APs) to Aruba Central using activation keys or device serials.

Associated devices to correct groups and sites for unified policy and configuration management.

Verified connectivity and provisioning status post-onboarding.

## 🔐 License Management
Added and assigned license subscriptions for both devices and features (Foundation/Advanced).

Ensured proper mapping of licenses across sites and monitored usage.

## 🛠️ Switch & AP Configuration
Applied and managed group-based configurations (VLANs, IP addressing, uplinks, SNMP, NTP, etc.).

Implemented port-level settings including access/trunk modes, PoE, and port security.

## Site and Group Setup
Created logical sites and groups for structured device management.

# Mapped physical locations with floor plans and topology view.

Applied configuration templates for each group.

## 📊 Monitoring
Monitored device health, status, and performance using:

Device summary views

Alerts and thresholds

Uptime, connectivity, and bandwidth graphs

Used Aruba Central mobile app for basic monitoring and alerts.

## 🔄 Firmware Management
Scheduled and performed firmware upgrades for switches and APs.

Verified upgrade status and rollback where needed.

Followed best practices for minimal downtime and staged updates.

## 🧹 Decommissioning
Safely removed devices from Aruba Central during site shutdown or replacement.

Revoked licenses and updated inventory documentation.
